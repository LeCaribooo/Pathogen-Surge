# Pathogen-Surge

## What is it ?

In this project you are a virus that chooses which area of the human body you want to infect. You will then have to cross blood vessels in a relentless race to try and infest a vital organ. This game is intended to be educational, and at the end of the race (if you succeed) you will be able to see the organ in 3D with a brief description of its function.
